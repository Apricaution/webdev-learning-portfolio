<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I hold myself to high standards regarding my education and personal development.
Throughout my academic career, I worked hard to maintain a high GPA across 
all my courses - displaying my ability to learn new skills and information effectively. 
My dedicated efforts paid off when I graduated summa cum laude from the University of 
Texas at Dallas in December 2023 (BS in Computer Science and Certificate in 
Information Assurance). I am now seeking to further my education and earn both 
CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications by the end of 2024. I also have future 
goals for continuous learning throughout my career and plan to earn further certifications,
such as the CySA+ and CISA.

I have also done a fair amount of work to develop myself professionally throughout my life.
The earliest achievement to showcase this would have been earning my rank of Eagle Scout 
within the Boy Scouts of America - setting me up with a solid foundation of leadership skills,
work ethic, and project management experience. I continued my professional development during 
my time at Collin College, joining the Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) honor society and serving in a 
couple of leadership positions. I acted as both the executive vice president for my local 
chapter, Alpha Mu Tau, and as the District II vice president for PTK's Texas region. In these
positions, I gained extensive experience working with many diverse teams, each requiring 
effective communication, team coordination, and time management to achieve our goals. 
I am proud to say many of the teams I had the honor to work with earned awards for their
projects at PTK's regional and national levels. I also earned a few personal awards for 
academic and leadership excellence.

Moving forward, I am eager to leverage my education and skills in pursuit of new challenges
and opportunities for growth. Whether working individually or collaboratively, I am committed
to delivering exceptional results, contributing positively to any team I join, and continuing
to develop my knowledge along the way.
