# webdev-learning-portfolio
This is a portfolio to keep track of my progress in learning full-stack web development.
Credit where credit is due:
My full-stack web development journey starts with The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp
by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.com
Many of the projects will follow along with her course until I have the skills to do more of my own thing.
